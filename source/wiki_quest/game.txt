i am wiki-quest game program, i say:

like in conquiztador, i ask players trivia questions
i fetch wikipedia page and extract 10 random sentences that have numbers in them, i replace numbers with blank
i show players the sentence, they have 10-20 seconds to answer with the number they think is there
player whose number is closest or, if equal, who answered faster, wins
players score points for each question, the overall winner is the player with highest score
